\section{Conclusions}\label{S:Conclusions}
We have presented a new estimator for the maximum expected value of a set of random variables, based on a weighted average of the sample means. 
% We tested it on different domains with different settings and we evaluated its performance compared to the state of the art. 
An extensive empirical analysis confirms what has been observed in the theoretical analysis, showing that no estimator is always the best. Nevertheless, our estimator has a robust behavior performing well in all conditions and obtaining the best performance in most of the ``non-trivial'' cases.\\
% Further researches will be done using different distributions instead of the Gaussian if the variable distribution of the problem is known, even if Gaussian approximation seems to work well in practice.
% Another worthwhile study would be to define theoretical conditions where Weighted policy is more helpful than other policies.
As future work, in order to apply the proposed estimator to continuous reinforcement learning problems, it will be interesting to extend \WE~to the case where Q-values are not stored in a table, but are represented through regression models such as trees or neural networks.
