The indicators choosen to define the states are: Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator, Relative Strenght Index, Momentum, Channel Commodity Index, Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands, Moving Average Cross-Over
The actions suggested by the indicators are computed by setting the parameters and the entry-exit conditions following the most used and common rules for these indicators.
In particular all the signals are defined using implemented Matlab Financial Toolbox functions and setting parameter and conditions like below.

- Moving Average Covergence/Divergence indicator:
The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average from the 12-period moving average. A 9 period exponential moving average is used as signal line.
When the MACD falls below the signal line a long position signal is produced.
Otherwise if the MACD surpasses the signal line a short position signal is produced.

-Relative Strenght Index:
The period choosen for the RSI is 20 days.
When the RSI is under the value of 30 an oversold market condition occurs, so a long position signal is produced.
Similarly, when the RSI is over 70, a short position signal is generated.
When the value is between these two bounds a close position signal is produced.

-Momentum
The momentum use a period of 14 days. The strategy is to be “always in the market”. In particular if the value of the momentum is less than zero a long position signal is generated. Otherwise  a short position signal is generated.

-Channel Commodity Index
The CCI is used with a 20 days period. The long position signal is produced when the cci cross and surpasses the lower bound of -100. The short position is taken when the CCI falls behind the value of 100. Otherwise the close position signal is generated.

-Stochastic Oscillator
The Stochastic oscillator use the high prices, low prices, and close prices with a 14 days period for the \%K line and 3  for the \%D line.
If both lines are above the value of 80 and the \%K line falls behind \%D line, then a short position signal is generated.
If both lines are below 20 and the \%K line surpass the \%D line, a long position signal is generated. In other conditions a “close position signal” is generated.

-Bollinger Bands
The bollinger bands signal is produced with a window size of 20.
“Long position” signal is produced when the closing price surpasses the upper bollinger band.
When the closing price falls down the lower band, then a “short position” signal is taken.
Otherwise a “close position signal” is generated.

-Moving Average Cross-Over
We used two moving average of 20 and 200 periods. A  long position signal is produced when the 20 period moving average falls behind the 200 periods one. Otherwise a “short position” signal is generated.
